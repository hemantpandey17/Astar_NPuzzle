# Astar_NPuzzle
To implement N Puzzle problem using A star and IDA star algorithm.

This program has been built as a part of Artifiial Intelligence Assignment 1 in my first semester of Stony Brook University. If you are using or taking ideas from the code, please give the reference of my github. 

2 files:
puzzleGenerator.py - generates the number of 3 or 4 puzzles to test
puzleSolver.py - gives the time, number of states traversed and the complete solution.

If any problem with the undersanding and working, do message.
